# ✍️ Hablemos en 10

**A writing companion for my grandmother's book of essays.**

> *"Hablemos en 10"* means *"Let's talk in 10 minutes"* — the idea is simple: pick a topic, start a 10-minute timer, and write freely.

## About the Project

My grandmother is 91 years old. She was born in Corrientes, Argentina, worked as a teacher her whole life, traveled the world, danced, and made artisan crafts. She recently started writing a book — not a memoir, but a collection of essays with her opinions and wisdom on topics that matter to her: education, politics, the economy, carnavales, travel, and more.

I built **Hablemos en 10** as a birthday gift for her. It's a tablet-friendly web app that serves as a guide for her handwriting sessions. She doesn't type — she looks at the screen, gets inspired by a topic, and writes by hand in her physical book.

### How It Works

1. She opens the app and sees a warm, personalized greeting
2. She taps **"Dame un tema"** (Give me a topic)
3. The app generates a topic powered by AI, with keywords and guiding questions — deeply grounded in Corrientes culture, Argentine history, and her personal interests
4. She taps **"Empezar a escribir"** and a 10-minute timer starts
5. She writes in her book while the timer counts down
6. When time's up, the topic is saved to her history

The AI-generated topics are contextually aware: they reference local traditions like the Carnavales de Corrientes, Argentine economic history, education from her era, world figures she follows on TV, and the places she's traveled.

## Design Principles

This app was designed for a specific user: a 91-year-old woman using a tablet. Every design decision reflects that:

- **Minimum 18px body text**, 24px+ for headings and timer
- **Maximum 2–3 actions** visible at any time
- **No scrolling required** on main screens
- **High contrast** warm palette (cream background, golden accents)
- **Typography**: Merriweather (headings) + Nunito (body) — warm, readable, literary
- **All UI in Argentine Spanish** with a familiar, loving tone

## Development Process

This project was built in 8 phases, from skeleton setup through deployment. Each phase was scoped, tested, and completed incrementally. The full roadmap is documented in [PHASES.md](./PHASES.md).

AI-assisted development was used throughout via [Claude Code](https://claude.ai), with project context maintained in [CLAUDE.md](./CLAUDE.md).
